A package represents a directory that contains group of classes and interfaces. 
Eg : import java.io.*;
    Here, java.io is a package name.
    java.io package contains a set of classes and interfaces that supports input and output operations.
    java.lang package is automatically imported into all the programs.
    java.lang package contains the fundamental classes and interfaces of Java language.

->There are two types of packages in Java: built-in packages and user-defined packages.
Built-in Packages: The packages which are already defined in Java API are called built-in packages.
    Eg : java.lang, java.io, java.util, java.sql etc.

User-defined Packages: The packages which are defined by users such as java. awt, java. lang etc. are called user-defined packages.
    -> The users can also create their own packages by defining the classes in the package by using the 'package' keyword, 
    followed by the package name at the top of the program.
    -> User-defined packages can also be imported in the same way as the built-in packages.

package declaration :
Syntax : package packageName;  // to create a package
         package packageName.subPackageName; // to create a subpackage

While creating the class in a package is to declare all the members and the class itself as public, except
the instance variables. The reason is only that the public members are available outside the package to other programs.
