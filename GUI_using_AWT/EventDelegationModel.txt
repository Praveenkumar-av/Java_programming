    When we create a component, generally the component is displayed on the screen but is not capable 
of performing any actions. 
    An event represents a specific action done on a component. Clicking, double Clicking, typing data 
inside the component, mouse over, etc are all examples of events.
    A listener is an interface which listens to an event coming from a component. A listener 
will have some abstract methods which need to be implemented by the programmer.
    When an event is generated by the user on the component, the event is not handled by the 
component. On the other hand, the component sends (delegates) that event to the listener attached
to it. The listener will not handle the event. It hands over (delegates) the event to an appropriate
method. Finally, the method is executed and the event is handled. This is called 'event delegation modedl'.
