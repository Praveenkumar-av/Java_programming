StringBuilder class has same features like StringBuffer class.
StringBuilder class objects are also mutable like StringBuffer class objects.

To create StringBuilder class object :
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(10);
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

Difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder class :
    StringBuffer class is synchronized whereas StringBuilder class is not synchronized.

    Synchronization does not allow more than 1 thread to simultaneously act on the object. When several threads act on StringBuffer object, 
they are executed one by one on the object, thus ensuring reliable result.

    But in StringBuilder object, it allows several threads to act on it simultaneously. This may lead to inaccurate results in some cases.
    StringBuffer class will take more execution time than StringBuilder class.
    StringBuffer class is used in multithreaded environment whereas StringBuilder class is used in single threaded environment.
