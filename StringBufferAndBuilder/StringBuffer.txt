String Buffer class in Java

String class objects are immutable. This means that once the String object is created, it cannot be changed. 
If you try to change the value of the existing String object, a new object is created rather than changing the previous one.

StringBuffer class is used to create mutable (modifiable) string objects. Moreover the methods that directly manipulate
data are not available in String class. Such methods are available in StringBuffer class.
