Collection objects 

A collection object or container is an object which can store a group of objects.
A collection object has a class known as 'collection class' or 'container class'. 
All the collection classes are available in the package, java.util. (util stands for utility).
A group of collection classes is called as 'collection framework'. 

JVM does not store the copies of other objects, it simply stores the references of other objects
into a collection object.

Retrieving elements from Collections :
    using for-each loop
    using Iterator interface
    using ListIterator interface
    using Enumeration interface
