Inheritance in Java
    Deriving new classes from existing classes such that the new classes acquire all the features 
of existing classes is called inheritance. We use 'extends' keyword.
Syntax : class subclass extends superclass

    *Java supports only single inheritance. Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java.
    
    *The programmer can achieve multiple inheritance by repeatedly using single inheritance(multilevel inheritance).

    *The programmer can achieve multiple inheritance by using interfaces.
