An array represents a group of elements of same data type. It can store a group of elements.
So we can store group of int values or group of float values or group of char string in array.
But we can not store different data type in same array.
In java, arrays are created on dynamic memory, i.e allotted at run time by JVM.
Types :
    Single Dimensional Array
    Multi Dimensional Array
    Jagged Array
