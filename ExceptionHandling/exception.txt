Exceptions in Java
Basically, an exception is an runtime error.
Checked exception :
    The exceptions that are checked at compile time are called 'checked exceptions'. 

Unchecked exceptions :
    The exceptions that are checked by the JVM are called 'Unchecked exceptions'.

Throwable is a class that represents all errors and exceptions which may occur in a java program.

-> An exception can be handled by using try,catch and finally block.
-> It is possible to handle multiple exceptions by using multiple catch blocks.
-> A single catch block can also be used to catch multiple exceptions using the ( | ) symbol.
-> Even though there is possiblity for several exceptions in try block, at a time only one exception 
will be raised.
-> A single try block can be followed by multiple catch blocks.
-> It is possible to write a try block within another block. They are called nested try blocks.
