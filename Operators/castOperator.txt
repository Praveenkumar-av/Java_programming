Cast operator is used to convert one data type into another data type. 
This operator can be used by writing datatype in parenthesis before the value to be converted.

Example:
double x = 10.2;
int y = (int)x; // y = 10

In the above statement, (int) is called the cast operator.
Cast operator is generally used before a variable or before a method.
